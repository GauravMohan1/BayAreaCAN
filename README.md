# BayAreaCAN

Bay Area CAN is a Twilio Messaging Service that provides personalized newsletters with COVID-related news to subscribers based on the county they reside in the Bay Area.

Our Application utilizes Twilio API to create a phone number, connect it to a webhook hosted on Heroku for full automation, and create automated messages to add subcribers to our Relational Database. Ngrok was utilized for development of the messaging service and the app was fully launched through Heroku. 

The app has over 10 writers who generate the content on the COVID newsletter which includes daily updated stats on COVID cases scraped from prominent COVID resources using Selenium, as well as relevant county related news effective COVID rules in specific counties. The writers generate content through a webform developed using REACT.

Over the course of 3 months since launch in November 2020, we have grown the user base to above 200+ Bay Area Residents.
